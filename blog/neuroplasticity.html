    <h2>Cultural Blog - What is Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset?</h2>
      <p>
          This time in this blog, I will be discussing neuroplasticity and 'growth mindset', and how both concepts can be used to positively influence learning. Both are similar concepts, and can be very useful in developing and molding one's mind to overcome and succeed at one's endeviours.    
      </p>
    <h3><em>Neuroplasticity</em></h3>
      <p>
          Neuroplasticity is a concept in neuroscience that suggests that the brain can be 're-wired' based on certain stimuli. It involves the brain adapting to these stimuli by restructing and functionally changing areas of the brain to better process certain actions. This has applications within neurological medicine, by helping those who have experience brain damage to recover by altering the still functioning sections of their brain; but more importantly for this blog, neuroplasticity can be used to mold your own brain on a daily basis, to help you learn new things and improve your cognitive ability.

      <p>
          Functionally as adults age, we only keep nerve pathways in our brain that we use, via a process known as 'synaptic pruning'. But as a byproduct of knowing this, we also know how to build new pathways in our brain, to help us learn new skills. Mainly, you need to practice. By repeating certain actions (i.e. using javascript) you continue to reinforce the synaptic pathways associated with that skill. Other notable actions that can help with cultivating these pathways include exercise, resting effectively by sleeping, as well as mediation and other forms of mindfulness.

    <h3><em>Having a 'Growth Mindset'</em></h3>
      <p>
          Having a growth mindset is a way at approaching learning. It is essentially a certain outlook that promotes thinking of learning as a journey, that you may not be suceeding or understanding fully what you are learning at the moment, but you will eventually 'grow' and develop understanding for these concepts. This is very important for not being 'bogged down' by your own expectations of success. During a lot of my early education, I had what is known as a fixed mindset, believing that if I didn't get a concept as I learnt it, I wasn't going to get it, or I was unable to learn it. However, I believe I developed a growth mindset around college, and started to see the challenge of learning as what it is, a challenge that I can work on and achieve eventually. And that is what having a growth mindset is in a nut shell its believing you can learn something despite it being difficult, which goes on to further influence your learning via positive thinking.
