    <h2> Technical Blog Post: CSS Concepts </h2>
    <h3><em>Differences between Relative, Absolute and Fixed Positioning</em></h3>
      <p>Our work in sprint 2 has been focused on learning and understanding how to use HTML and CSS. I found that HTML came easily to me, but when it came time to add CSS code, and get it to interact with the content on my webpage I hit a block. Understanding concepts like colour were fine, but I really had a lot of trouble with website responsiveness and element positioning. So for this part of my technical blog, I wanted to go over the research I've done into positioning, and how I now understand it a lot better.</p>
      <p>The first thing to note is, there are more than the three types of positioning that I am going over in this post, which can also be useful in making a website feel more accessible. But to start we need to talk about the defult property. </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Static Positioning</strong></h4>   
          <p>Static positioning is the basic, defult property that all elements have. Without any additional position properties, the elemental will act statically. This means it will generally be moving down the working axis of the page, typically vertically. This doesn't give us a lot to work with, so we add other positioning properties to class and ID elements to move them around the page. For example here is some experimenting code I wrote while researching the topic, either following along with youtube tutorials or reading up on tech help websites:</p>
            <div class ="img-row">
              <div class="img-column"></div>
                <img class="example-1" src="../images/html-css-blogpost/example1-CSSblog.png" alt="Example 1"> 
              <div class="img-column">
                <img class="example1-code" src="../images/html-css-blogpost/example1-code.png" alt="Example 1 Code">
              </div>
            </div>
          <p>With that out of the way we can move on to...</p>
