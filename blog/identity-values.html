          <h2>My Identity and Values</h2>
            <p>Its hard to write about yourself. Even with evidence from various sources, such as friends and family. But I am going to give a go at it.</p>
            <p>My close friends say that I value dignity repsect and loyalty. They value my openness and adaptability to new ideas, as well as my williness to debate and discuss new ideas. I find that I may take this for granted, I expect people to challenge others and gain perspective from various sources. Which is no surprise that my close friends also believe that I value excellence and expect excellence from those around me. Lastly they mention my kind-hearted nature and integrity, how I attempt to cultivate and maintain positive relationships with those around me. </p>
              <h3>My Core Values</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Respect</li>
                <li>Honesty</li>
                <li>Loyalty</li>
                <li>Fairness</li>
                <li>Perseverance</li>
              </ul>
            <p>I find that family is also very important to me. I find time to be with both my immediate and extended family, and even though I am still not the most present family member, I do try to be there for the important occasions.</p>
          <h3>Where do these Values come from?</h3>
            <p>Books mostly. I read a lot of heroic fantasy, and I think that influenced a lot of my core values. I was also raised Roman Catholic, and a lot of my values from my family, follow loose church doctrine.</p>
