          <h3><em>What is Emotional Intelligence?</em></h3>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence (also known as EQ or EI) is an individuals ability to perceive, understand and control emotions, of themselves and others around them. As such people who have high EQ are generally better at communicating with others, better at dealing with their emotions and being more empathetic; and people who show lower EQ are more prone to getting into arguments, have worse interpersonal relationships and lack self-cofidence.</p>
            <p>There are multiple models of EQ, but it generally accepted that EQ is comprised of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Perceiving Emotions, of others or yourself.</li>
                <li>Reasoning with Emotions, or the utilisation of emotion.</li>
                <li>Understanding Emotions, interpreting your own emotions or those of others.</li>
                <li>Managing Emotions, or how well you deal with emotional situations.</li>
              </ul>
          
          <h3><em>What is the difference between Emotional Intelligence and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)?</em></h3>
            <p>IQ is a generally accepted form of measuring academic intelligence. Where IQ deals with abstract problem solving, making plans, ultilising logic, and the application of information; EQ is showing empathy for others, being able to accept responsiblity and reflect on criticism, general listening skills and being above to identify and share your feelings.</p>
            <p>It is also important to note, that while whether or not IQ can be increased or not is still debated (personally I believe it can be), it is generally accepted that EQ can be increased by self-improvement.</p>
          
          <h3><em>Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?</em></h3>
            <p>Some experts say that EQ is more important than IQ alone for success in life. Generally, the smartest people aren’t the most successful in work or in life. IQ helps, but EQ allows you to otherwise thrive within emotion drive communities, i.e. families, workplaces or any other group of human beings on the planet.</p>
            <p>EQ is very important how you manage relationships. It allows for easier communication and helps cultivate stronger connections with others. As such EQ is important for effective leadership, as well as working effectively within teams. It allows for the identification of emotions within yourself, and others with allows you to communicate better and helps reduce the potential for conflict.</p>
