    <h2>Tech Blog - Approaching Problem-Solving</h2>
      <p>
          In this weeks tech blog, I will be discussing my approaches to problem solving while working through the weeks work. 
      </p>
    <h3><em>Problems with buzzing</em></h3>
      <p>
          A lot of the issues I had with the Javascript Kata were in deBuzz kata. The main issue I ran into with the deBuzz assignment was trying to solve how to remove variations of the same word, i.e. when its capitalised. When it initially stumpted me, I tried to log out my code into the console, but found that it would only return the buzzing code, so I went to google. Google was more helpful, I discovered that I needed to filter the sentence, after turning that sentence into an array, as well as convert the entire sentence to lowercase. However I still couldn't work out how to implement what I had found. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
          After this I went to discord, where I looked through the tech-questions, to see if anyone had the same problem, when I found that one facilitator had made a game to walk through the process in a similar problem. It took me a bit of time to work through the game, but eventually I had the exact code that I needed, and I still couldn't get it to work. After this I sat for a moment and talked to myself, and asked what I needed, while writing a bit of pseudocode. I was surprised how obvious the thing I was missing was. I forgot to define a new variable where the new information would be stored. After that it worked completely fine.
      </p>
      <p>
          Throughout the process, I felt frustrated, but motivated to find the answer, I knew I was missing something, so it drove me to try and find it. What I learnt was that sometimes the easiest thing to do is just sit for a moment, and go over what you need to do. Once you make a list, it becomes very clear what you've missed.
      </p>
    <h3><em>Figuring out Objects</em></h3>
      <p>
          A time I worked through my problems a bit more effectively was with the manipulating objects kata. Intially when looking at changing objects, I found it a bit difficult. Generally because if I wanted to change an object, I would just change the object, not manipulate it with commands. However once I visited the mdn resources on objects, I found that it was as simple as just typing what you wanted to happen. It again was surprisingly simple once I understood what was required, and I learnt that sometimes, a line of code does everything you want, and that you don't need to write a function for everything.
      </p>
    <h3><em>Problem Solving Techniques - One's I'm Comfortable With and One's I'm Not.</em></h3>
      <p>
          I feel confident starting, and adding to pseudocode as I write, I like to use it to format my work as I go, as well as to write notes and steps to accomplish, though maybe I need a bit more experience in knowing what the steps I actually need <em>are</em>. Trying something, testing it and then itterating on it also is my usual go to, as well as reading error messages and googling for tips or how a function actually works. I use the Rubber Ducky method to clear up what I'm doing, and to work through what I actually need to accomplish to get something to work.
      </p>
      <p>
          I still find it to ask other's for help. I can sometimes feel like I am bothering others when I do or I am 'putting someone out' but asking. I know it isn't true, but it is something I am still working on, and I have been getting better at it.
