    <h3>My Wellbeing Plan and Te Whare Tapa Whā</h3>
      <p>
          In this blog, I will be using the Te Whare Tapa Whā Wellbeing model to outline a wellbeing plan for my time at DevAcademy, and beyond. Above is the outline of the model, showing the 'walls' that guide the model. One by one I will go through each wall and describe my plan for how I will look after this aspect of my personal wellbeing.
      </p>
    
    <h3><em>Taha Tiana</em></h3>
      <p>
          Taha Tiana is about your physical wellbeing, which I personally struggle with quite a bit. Exercise doesn't exactly come naturally to me, and I have a tendancy to order out a lot.
          So to keep it easy and achievable to start with, I want to:
          <ul>
              <li>Limit takeaway meals to once a week at the most.</li>
              <li>Go for a 30 minute walk each day.</li>
              <li>Set a sleep timer so I keep a consistent sleep schedule.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>

    <h3><em>Taha Hinengaro</em></h3>
      <p>
          Taha Hinengaro is about mental and emotional wellbeing. This I am a bit better at and already have aspects of my life dedicated to this. Steps I can take to continue to maintain my mental/emotional wellbeing are:
          <ul>
            <li>Set a sleep timer and go for my walks; as this crosses over physical/mental wellbeing.</li>
            <li>Plan my weeks work, so that I am aware of my requirements and less likely to stress.</li>
            <li>Continue to practice my mindfullness meditations.</li>
            <li>Continue to use a journal to outline my thoughts.</li>
            <li>Meet with friends.</li>
            <li>Allow myself time to myself.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <h3><em>Taha Wairua</em></h3>
      <p>
          Taha Wairua touches on spiritual wellbeing. Though I'm not currently religious, I have always seen a spirtual nature to the world. A few things I can do to maintain this wall would be:
          <ul>
            <li>Continue with mindfullness meditations.</li>
            <li>Allow time for introspeciton and self-reflection, including journalling.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
    <h3><em>Taha Whānau</em></h3>
      <p>
          Taha Whānau is about family, and other close interpersonal relationships. I can struggle with communicaiton in certain ways, so this is an area which can I can lack with my personal wellbeing. Things I can do to strengthen this wall would be:
          <ul>
            <li>Contact my family regularly, be it by phone or in person.</li>
            <li>Despite being busy, make time for those who are important in my life, especially those I cannot see often.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
    <h3><em>Whenua</em></h3>
      <p>
        Whenua is about your connection to the land, or place of belonging. Lately, I have been neglicting this side of my wellbeing much like Taha Tiana. Though thinks like walking along a beach consistute a full on outing for me, which can be difficult to plan around at the best of times, little things I can do are:
        <ul>
          <li>Set outside while I eat lunch on the communal lawn at my home, or at a park if I'm out.</li>
          <li>Try to get out to the botanical gardens once a fortnight, as it is my favourite place in Wellington.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
