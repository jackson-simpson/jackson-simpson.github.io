        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1> 
      </div>
  
      <div class="container">
        <h2><em>Introduction</em></h2>
          <p>My learning plan will be used to guide my learning during my time at DevAcademy, as well as to review and reflect on when I may be experiencing difficulty with the content.</p>
            <h3>My Long Term Goals</h3>
              <p>My goals after DevAcademy is to move into a programming job, either as a web developer or Full-Stack Engineer, using the basis of what I have learnt as a foundation for more learning.</p>
            <h3>My Learning Strengths and Limitations</h3>
              <p>I am a persistant learner, someone who is determined to learn, and is curious. I enjoy problem-solving, and the feeling of success when I achieve, which in turn drives my learning forward.</p>
              <p>However, I can get easily distracted, I can lose track of time, become fixated on specific tasks; all of which can lead me to fall behind; which eventually leads me to feel discouraged.</p>
            <h3>Human Skills I would Like to Develop</h3>
              <p>I would like to develop my interpersonal skills, and try to become less awkward in professional settings.</p>
            <h3>My Commitments</h3>
            <p>I will commit to manage my workload. I will do so by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Planning my weeks ahead on the Monday, assigning time based on the given time boxes for the given task for that week.</li>
                <li>Have an open mindset when working with others.</li>
                <li>Be patient with myself and others I am working with.</li>
                <li>Apply techniques like self-timing, and timeboxing to help prevent myself from falling behind.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>I will commit to seeking help, by communicating with fellow students when I become stuck for more than 20 minutes. If I am unable to find the answer, I will ask the Facilitators for assistance. I will commit to this, so I am continuing to meet expectations around time-management.</p>
            <p>I commit to accounting for important appointments, personal tasks and breaks into my learning plan so that these are structured into my learning.</p>
          <h3>My Expectations for the Facilitators</h3>
            <p>My expectations from the Facilitation team are that they are present to answer questions or offer guidance during reasonable hours. I expect the facilitation team to be patient and kind when dealing with myself or any other student.</p>
