        <h2>A Reflection on Core Skills Learning in Foundations</h2>
          <h3><em>What are three new things you have learnt about youself and your ego due to the core learning?</em></h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>There is more to life than just being intelligent.</li>
                  <li>I know very little about myself emotionally and have a hard time reflecting on that.</li>
                  <li>If you want to improve, you can, you just have to start.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
          <h3><em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em></h3>
            <p>
            I think that values, empathy and self-awareness are very important when it comes to learning or programing. Though one could argue that self-awareness is the most important, as it is required for honest assessments of yourself and how you are learning, or how you are interacting with others, I would say that one's empathy is just as important as it helps inform your actions with other students or how you deal with collegues or programmers. 
            </p>
          <h3><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em></h3>
            <p>
                How little I knew about myself, and my values. When I started the core excerises at the beginning, I felt it was very hard to articulate what was important to me other than things like one word answers, i.e. honesty. As time went on, and I continued to practice mindfulness I found that it was easier to reflect inward.
            </p>
          <h3><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em></h3>
            <p>
                That most of it was self-directed, that a lot of the content that we needed to cover needed to be found through our own research. Though I am not unfamiliar with research, it has been a while since I've had to do a lot of it, and for the most part, a lot of the content I was somewhat unfamiliar with. 
            </p>
          <h3><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</em></h3>
            <p>
                Because like the skills we gain from learning programming and the other tech focused skills, the core skills which are taught are aimed at making us better programmers. By learning how to be self-aware, and how to tackle problems in teams, and how to interact with others, we become better team members rather than just better coders.
            </p>
          <h3><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></h3>
            <p>
                I don't believe the time spent learning core was a waste of time. Though I may have found more time spent on the tech content more useful, I don't think that diminishes the value of learning the core skills. These skills are things a lot of people struggle with, myself included, and being taught ways of planning, or methods of helping train your brain, and becoming more reflective, are positive life-long skills which can help you in any profession; or in any situation really. So I am glad I learnt more core skills, and am looking forward to learning more and putting them into practice in bootcamp.
