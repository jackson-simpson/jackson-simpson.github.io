    <p>Hello, and welcome to my student blog! On this I will be adding blog posts chronicling my journey and experimentation with programming and website development. Hopefully, how this page looks now will in time be transformed by the learning and experience I gain during my time on this course, and I am excited to continue to continue to tweak, fomate and re-tweak this page.</p>
    <p> My general goals for this blog are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Complete my required learning compentencies and outcomes.</li>
        <li>Upload posts about my learning and experiences, as well as required tasks and assignments.</li>
        <li>Experiment within this website, try new styles of code for HTML, CSS and eventually JavaScript</li>
      </ol>
    <p> All the while having fun doing so!</p>
    <p> The blog posts, as well as information <a href="./blog/about-me.html">about myself</a> can be found by moving through the site using the navigation bar (which took me forever to make horizontal) or by following any inline links.</p>
